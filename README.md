Start by running PlayAGame.java.  As a user, you can choose one of three puzzle games to play (Sudoku, Ken-Ken, or the Color Game).  All three call files from the command line.  This way, you can switch out files to play a different Sudoku or different Ken-Ken, etc.  The three files I have provided are evilsudoku.txt, kenken.txt, and color.txt.  To switch what puzzle you're playing, click on the button "Menu".  To make a move, click on any empty button in the grid below the first row.  I also created one solver (located in class Solver) that will solve any of the three types of puzzle games.  If you want the computer to solve the game for you, press the button "Solution".  This was created in Java and opens a GUI.
